- **Deep Dream Visualization:**  
  Turn ordinary images into fantastic, hallucinogenic artwork using InceptionV3 or VGG16 neural networks.
- **Neural Style Transfer:**  
  Mash up content and style images to create beautiful blends, just like an AI-powered painter.
- **Jupyter Notebooks:**  
  Interactive, step-by-step guides make exploring these techniques simple for everyone.
- **Multi-Model Support:**  
  Experiment with both InceptionV3 and VGG16 for diverse artistic results.
